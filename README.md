# WIP WIP

### Introduce

Duckie is a service that combines the characteristics of [Karrot-market](https://us.karrotmarket.com/)'s used transaction in a free anonymous space like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). Check out the [Duckie Tech blog](https://blog.duckie.team/duckie-%EB%A5%BC-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4-70b6a06ec806) for more details. (ko)

### Download

Duckie can be downloaded at the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?team.duckie.android). But now, it is currently under development and cannot be downloaded.

### Build

Duckie is developed using the latest version of Android Studio Canary. And also requires a build configuration file. Therefore, to build, you need to unzip the `duckieuser-secrets.tar` file. You can do it easily with the following command:

```bash
tar xvf duckieuser-secrets.tar
```
